## üõ†Ô∏è Building Your Own Integration

### 1. Setup PersonaKit Client
```python
from personakit import PersonaKitClient

client = PersonaKitClient(
    base_url="http://localhost:8042",
    api_key="your-api-key"
)
```

### 2. Record Observations
```python
await client.create_observation(
    person_id="user-123",
    observation_type="user_action",
    content={
        "action": "completed_onboarding",
        "preferences": ["visual_learning", "hands_on"]
    }
)
```

### 3. Generate Personas
```python
persona = await client.create_persona(
    person_id="user-123",
    mapper_id="career-guidance-mapper"
)
```

### 4. Use Personas in Your App
```python
if persona.core.get("learning_style") == "visual":
    # Show diagrams and charts
else:
    # Show text-based content
```

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Record Meaningful Observations**: Every significant user action should create an observation
2. **Use Real Data**: Don't hardcode personas - let PersonaKit generate them
3. **Respect Privacy**: Only collect what's needed for personalization
4. **Provide Value**: Make personalization benefits clear to users

## ü§ù Contributing Examples

When adding a new example:
1. Create a clear README with setup instructions
2. Include start/stop scripts
3. Document which traits and mappers you use
4. Keep examples focused on a specific use case
5. Use consistent ports (8100-8199 range)
