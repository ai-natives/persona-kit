# PersonaKit Application Examples

PersonaKit enables domain-specific agents to model and embody real people. Each application uses PersonaKit differently based on its role-playing needs:

- **High-Fidelity Embodiment**: English learning (colleague simulation), interview prep (interviewer personas)
- **Behavioral Adaptation**: Personal assistants (matching user work style), coaching (maintaining coach consistency)  
- **Supportive Modeling**: Therapy (crisis-appropriate responses), career counseling (empathetic guidance)
- **Analytical Mirroring**: Strategy advisor (thinking like the user), product assistant (using PM's frameworks)

## Core Principle

**PersonaKit = Human Modeling for Role-Playing Agents**
- Enables agents to embody specific real people
- Provides controllable fidelity levels (basic traits to richer approximations)
- Maintains behavioral consistency during role-play
- Adapts as new observations arrive about the modeled person
- Supports flexible usage patterns (persistent, dynamic, or hybrid)

**Applications = Domain-Specific Agents That Need Human Modeling**
- Training scenarios requiring useful approximations of human interaction
- Analysis tools that think like specific people
- Support systems that adapt to individual styles
- Simulation environments for practice and preparation

## Example Application Types

### 1. Coaching App: The Coaching Agent
**Purpose**: A coaching agent that maintains consistency with a specific coach's style, adapts based on client progress, and evolves as the coach's methods improve.

**Why PersonaKit**: The agent needs to embody the actual coach - not be a generic coaching bot. Clients build relationships with their specific coach's personality and approach.

**Key Traits:**
- `coaching.philosophy` - Growth-mindset, accountability-focused, empathy-first
- `coaching.techniques` - Socratic questioning, direct feedback, visualization
- `coaching.pacing` - Push hard, gentle progression, client-led
- `coaching.communication` - Formal professional, casual mentor, tough love
- `coaching.specialties` - Executive presence, life transitions, habit formation

**Sample Observations:**
```json
{
  "type": "coaching_session",
  "content": {
    "coach_id": "coach_sarah_123",
    "technique_used": "reframing_exercise",
    "client_response": "breakthrough_moment",
    "session_energy": "high_engagement",
    "outcomes": ["clarity_achieved", "action_plan_created"]
  }
}
```

**Sample Persona:**
```json
{
  "core": {
    "coaching_identity": "Coach Sarah Martinez",
    "philosophy": "accountability_with_compassion",
    "signature_techniques": ["powerful_questions", "pattern_interruption"],
    "communication_style": "warm_but_direct"
  },
  "overlay": {
    "recent_insights": "Visualization exercises working well this month",
    "current_focus": "Helping clients with Q4 planning",
    "energy_level": "Energized from recent client successes"
  }
}
```

**Agent Usage Patterns:**
```python
# Option 1: Your personal coach (stable persona that evolves with you)
class YourPersonalCoach:
    def __init__(self, client_id: str):
        # Each client gets their coach's evolving persona
        self.coach_persona = personakit.get_persona(f"coach_for_{client_id}", fidelity=0.8)
        self.initialize_with_persona(self.coach_persona)
        
    async def conduct_session(self):
        # Always coaches in the same style you've come to trust
        # But the persona evolves as your coach:
        # - Learns what motivates you specifically
        # - Discovers which techniques work best for you
        # - Adapts their approach based on your progress
        greeting = self.greet_client()  # Consistent style
        session = self.run_coaching_session()  # Evolving effectiveness
        return session

# Option 2: Multi-coach platform (switches between coaches)
class CoachingPlatformAgent:
    async def conduct_session(self, coach_id: str, client_id: str):
        # Adopts requested coach's persona for this session
        coach_persona = await personakit.get_persona(coach_id, fidelity=0.8)
        self.adopt_persona(coach_persona)
        
        session = self.run_coaching_session()
        
        # Might maintain persona for follow-ups or switch to another
        return session
```

- `work.interaction_preference` - Formal, casual, minimal, chatty

**Agent Adoption Pattern:**
```python
class AssistantAgent:
    async def daily_standup(self, user_id: str):
        # Adopt the user's preferred assistant style
        user_persona = await personakit.get_persona(user_id, fidelity=0.6)
        self.adopt_persona(user_persona)
        
        # Communicate in their preferred style
        if user_persona.core.communication_style == "brief_bullets":
            return self.generate_bullet_summary()
        else:
            return self.generate_detailed_briefing()
```

**Usage Examples:**
```python
# Option 1: Stable persona that evolves with the user
class YourTeamCoach:
    def __init__(self, user_id: str):
        # Initialize with your manager's coaching style
        self.coach_persona = personakit.get_persona(f"manager_coach_{user_id}", fidelity=0.8)
        self.initialize_with_persona(self.coach_persona)
        self.user_id = user_id
    
    def provide_feedback(self, situation: str):
        # Always coaches in your manager's style
        # But the persona evolves as new observations arrive about how
        # your manager actually coaches you
        return self.analyze_situation_as_manager(situation)

# Option 2: Multi-person training platform
class TeamSimulationPlatform:
    async def practice_with_colleague(self, colleague_id: str):
        # Temporarily adopts different colleagues for practice scenarios
        colleague = await personakit.get_persona(colleague_id, fidelity=0.9)
        self.adopt_persona(colleague)
        
        session = self.run_practice_conversation()
        return session
```

        self.adopt_persona(interviewer)
        
        # Conduct realistic interview
        questions = self.generate_interview_questions()  # In interviewer's style
        responses = self.evaluate_answers()  # Using interviewer's criteria
        
        self.release_persona()
        
        # Provide feedback as helpful agent
        return self.generate_interview_feedback(responses)
```

    "stakeholders_consulted": ["eng_lead", "design_lead", "sales"],
    "decision_speed": "48_hours",
    "outcome": "shipped_successfully"
  }
}
```

**How the Agent Uses PersonaKit:**
```python
# In the Product Management App (NOT in PersonaKit):
class ProductAssistantAgent:
    def __init__(self, pm_id: str):
        # PersonaKit just provides memory and personas
        self.pm_id = pm_id
        
    async def assist_with_feature_prioritization(self, features: list[Feature]):
        # Get PM's working style
        pm_persona = await personakit.get_persona(self.pm_id, fidelity=0.7)
        self.adopt_persona(pm_persona)
        
        # Work the way this PM works
        if pm_persona.core.prioritization_framework == "RICE":
            analysis = self.generate_rice_scores(features)
        elif pm_persona.core.prioritization_framework == "jobs_to_be_done":
            analysis = self.analyze_customer_jobs(features)
            
        self.release_persona()
        return analysis
```

## Common Patterns Across Applications

### 1. Flexible Persona Usage
Agents can use personas in various ways based on their design:

```python
# Pattern A: Persistent persona (agent always embodies this person)
class DedicatedSarahBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.persona = personakit.get_persona("sarah_from_engineering", fidelity=0.9)
        self.initialize_with_persona(self.persona)

# Pattern B: Dynamic switching for different contexts
agent = FlexibleAgent()
persona = await personakit.get_persona(person_id, fidelity=0.8)
agent.adopt_persona(persona)
result = agent.perform_task()
# Can maintain persona, switch to another, or clear it

# Pattern C: Hybrid approach with default persona
agent = HybridAgent(default_persona="assistant_mike")
# Uses Mike persona by default, can switch for specific tasks
```

### 2. Fidelity Control  
Applications adjust detail level based on needs:
- **High (0.8-1.0)**: Maximum available detail for role-play (still approximations)
- **Medium (0.5-0.7)**: Key behavioral patterns and communication style
- **Low (0.2-0.4)**: Basic traits and preferences only

Note: Even at "high" fidelity, these are simplified models capturing perhaps 0.01% of a person's complexity - just enough to be useful for the specific use case.

### 3. The Power of Stable, Evolving Personas

This is where PersonaKit's real value emerges for agentic apps:

**Stable from the user's perspective:**
- Your fitness coach agent always embodies your specific trainer
- Your work assistant always operates in your preferred style  
- Your therapy support agent maintains consistent therapeutic approach

**Yet evolving based on new observations:**
- As your coach learns new techniques, the agent incorporates them
- As your work patterns change, your assistant adapts
- As therapeutic breakthroughs occur, the support agent adjusts

This creates a powerful feedback loop:
```python
class PersonalFitnessCoach:
    def __init__(self, user_id: str, coach_id: str):
        # Agent initialized with specific coach's persona
        self.persona = personakit.get_persona(coach_id, fidelity=0.8)
        self.initialize_with_persona(self.persona)
        
    def design_workout(self, user_state: dict):
        # Uses coach's methodology, which evolves as:
        # - Coach tries new techniques with user
        # - User responds to different approaches
        # - Coach's style naturally adapts
        # The agent automatically incorporates these evolutions
        return self.create_personalized_plan(user_state)
```

The user experiences consistency (same coach) with natural evolution (improving approach).

### 4. Privacy & Consent
All applications must handle:
- Explicit consent for modeling
- Access controls for personas
- Appropriate use boundaries
- Data retention policies

## The PersonaKit Advantage

1. **Realistic Role-Play**: Agents can actually embody specific people, not just pretend
2. **Behavioral Consistency**: Maintained across sessions and interactions
3. **Adaptive Modeling**: Personas improve as new observations arrive
4. **Flexible Fidelity**: From basic style matching to full embodiment
5. **Domain Agnostic**: Same infrastructure works across all use cases

This is how PersonaKit enables next-generation human modeling for training, analysis, support, and simulation applications.
