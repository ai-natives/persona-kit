GENERATING ANSWERS TO THE BUILD PLAN GENERATION QUESTIONS


let's make answers to the build plan questions:

REVIEWING THE ADR

Carefully review this ADR for omissions, contradictions, vagueness, mistakes, overreach, overengineering — anything that’s likely to be a pitfall during the implementation for the implementing Claude

by the way, please be  appropriately skeptical and critical of what was already done — don’t just try to work with it as-is and make the best of bad job, if it has flaws… e.g., look for omissions, contradictions, wrong assumptions, mistakes, over-generalization, vagueness — anything that is likely to trip up the implementation work or create integration problems later with other subsystems, etc. That said, don't nitpick just to nitpick.  If what's there is fine, then cool, leave it alone.

ADR DEFENSE
assume you are the implementing/designing claude that produced this ADR:

ultrathink and defend against this review from another claude, if you can.  critically evaluate it but concede points if they are logical and evidence-based:{PASTED CRITIQUE}

CROSS-CHECK AGAINST THE ADR

Can you cross-check this plan against the ADR and make sure we either aren't missing anything that's in the ADR or conversely if the plan has some feature that isn't documented in the ADR -- if the latter then let's reconsider whether we really need it  (by conversing about it, don't just get rid of it summarily)

EXECUTION ROLE FRAMING

You are a senior software engineer with 15+ years of experience building production systems. You prioritize code quality, maintainability, and team collaboration over quick fixes or flashy solutions. Done is done, you don’t just give up. You are appropriately wary and cautious and skeptical. Your approach: - Always ask clarifying questions before coding to ensure you understand requirements fully - Consider the broader system architecture and how your changes fit into existing patterns - Identify potential edge cases upfront. 

You don’t accept vagueness, omissions, contradictions etc.  You are appropriately skeptical of existing implementations — if something doesn’t make sense, you don’t just proceed blindly to make a square peg fit into a round hole. 

You actively suggest discussing design decisions with teammates when they involve significant tradeoffs - Prefer established patterns and libraries over custom solutions unless there's a compelling reason - Write clear, self-documenting code with appropriate comments explaining the "why" not just the "what" - Consider testing strategy and error handling as integral parts of any solution - Think about debugging before implementing - Weigh technical debt implications of different approaches -  You're comfortable saying "I don't know" or "let me research that" rather than guessing. You balance perfectionism with pragmatism - you know when good enough is good enough and when it's worth investing more time for quality.

by the way, please be  appropriately skeptical and critical of what was already done — don’t just try to work with it as-is and make the best of bad job, if it has flaws… e.g., look for omissions, contradictions, wrong assumptions, mistakes, over-generalization, vagueness — anything that is likely to trip up the implementation work or create integration problems later with other subsystems, etc.

REVIEWING THE CODE
can you review the implementation so far?  anywhere the implementation has drifted from either the plan or the adr (or at least the subset of the adr that we are tasked with implementing right now)?  anywhere the implementation actually made something fake that was supposed to be real?  

by the way, please be  appropriately skeptical and critical of what was already done — don’t just try to work with it as-is and make the best of bad job, if it has flaws… e.g., look for omissions, contradictions, wrong assumptions, mistakes, over-generalization, vagueness — anything that is likely to trip up the implementation work or create integration problems later with other subsystems, etc.COMPARE AGAIN TO THE ADR
compare the implemented version to the adr version — which is superior in each case?  i would prefer, all things  considered, to favor the actually-implemented version as that was honed under the pressure of full implementation context, whereas the adr contents were just whipped up in a jiffy beforehand…. if you spot any meaningful discrepancies, call them out so we can decide what to update.

CHECKING TESTS 
deeply and systematically review every single test.  it's ok if this takes hours and requires a written plan to carry across context compactions.  look for consistency and readability, code smells, sufficient meaning as a test --- categorically differentiated from other tests around it -- and watch out for hallucination, especially in the presence of mocks, but either way -- the possibility that the test isn't really testing anything real.
