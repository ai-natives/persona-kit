# PersonaKit Implementation Guide

## Strategic Vision: Human Modeling for Role-Playing Agents

PersonaKit enables agents to **temporarily embody specific real people** for training, simulation, and practice scenarios.

### Core Value Propositions

**For Agent Developers:**
- Working mental models of people for role-playing scenarios
- Controllable fidelity levels (basic traits to richer approximations)
- Behavioral consistency during embodiment  
- Self-improving models through feedback

**For End Users:**
- Practice with AI versions of real colleagues/managers
- Train against useful approximations of customer personas
- Prepare for interviews with company-specific interviewers
- Get advice from AI that thinks like specific people

### What PersonaKit Provides

1. **Human Modeling System**: Extract and model behavioral patterns of real people
2. **Persona Generation**: Create role-playing personas with adjustable fidelity
3. **Flexible Usage Patterns**: Agents can be initialized with personas or adopt them dynamically
4. **Continuous Learning**: Personas improve as new observations arrive

## Core Principle: Role-Playing Personas

### Fundamental Purpose: Agents That Embody Real People

PersonaKit exists for a specific purpose: **enabling agents to act as specific real people**. This isn't general personalization - it's human simulation for specialized use cases.

Key distinctions:
1. **Flexible embodiment**: Agents can be initialized with personas or adopt them dynamically
2. **Real people modeling**: Based on actual individuals, not archetypes
3. **Controllable realism**: Fidelity adjusts based on use case needs
4. **Usage flexibility**: Support for persistent personas, switching, or no persona

### The Persona Mapper's Role in Role-Playing

The Persona Mapper determines **how to construct a persona for role-playing**:
- Selects relevant traits for the specific role-play scenario
- Adjusts detail level based on requested fidelity
- Includes behavioral patterns, communication style, knowledge
- Evolves based on feedback about role-play accuracy

## Use Case Analysis

### 1. English Learning with Real Colleagues

**System Overview**: Practice English by having conversations with AI versions of actual colleagues, preparing for real workplace interactions.

**Role-Playing Requirements**:
- **Personas**: 20-50 actual colleagues per user
- **Fidelity**: High (0.8-0.9) - must feel like the real person
- **Observations**: Email samples, chat logs, meeting recordings
- **Key Traits**: Communication patterns, typical phrases, formality level
- **Feedback**: "Did this feel like talking to the real person?"

**Agent Behavior**:
```python
# Agent embodies specific colleague
colleague = personakit.get_persona("john_from_engineering", fidelity=0.85)
agent.adopt_persona(colleague)

# Conversation uses John's actual patterns
agent.chat("Can you explain the deployment process?")
# Response in John's style, with his knowledge

agent.release_persona()
```

### 2. Interview Prep with Company Interviewers

**System Overview**: Practice interviews with AI versions of typical interviewers from target companies.

**Role-Playing Requirements**:
- **Personas**: Various interviewer archetypes per company
- **Fidelity**: Medium-High (0.6-0.8) - realistic but not specific individuals
- **Observations**: Interview feedback, company culture docs, Glassdoor data
- **Key Traits**: Question style, evaluation criteria, company values
- **Feedback**: "Were the questions representative of this company?"

**Agent Behavior**:
```python
# Agent becomes a Google behavioral interviewer
interviewer = personakit.get_persona("google_behavioral_interviewer", fidelity=0.7)
agent.adopt_persona(interviewer)

# Conducts interview in Google style
agent.conduct_behavioral_round()

agent.release_persona()
# Returns to coaching mode to give feedback
```

### 3. Manager Review Preparation

**System Overview**: Prepare for performance reviews by practicing with an AI version of your actual manager.

**Role-Playing Requirements**:
- **Personas**: User's specific manager
- **Fidelity**: High (0.8-0.9) - must capture manager's style
- **Observations**: Past review comments, email exchanges, 1:1 notes
- **Key Traits**: Feedback style, priorities, communication patterns
- **Feedback**: "Did this match how my manager would respond?"

### 4. Sales Training with Customer Personas

**System Overview**: Practice sales pitches against AI versions of typical customer profiles.

**Role-Playing Requirements**:
- **Personas**: 50-100 customer archetypes
- **Fidelity**: Medium (0.5-0.7) - representative behaviors
- **Observations**: CRM data, sales call transcripts, objection patterns
- **Key Traits**: Buying concerns, objection style, decision criteria
- **Feedback**: "Were the objections realistic for this customer type?"

### Comparison Matrix

| Aspect | English Practice | Interview Prep | Manager Review | Sales Training |
|--------|------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Embodiment Type** | Specific people | Company archetypes | Specific person | Customer types |
| **Fidelity Needed** | High (0.8-0.9) | Medium-High (0.6-0.8) | High (0.8-0.9) | Medium (0.5-0.7) |
| **Persona Count** | 20-50 colleagues | 5-10 per company | 1 manager | 50-100 customers |
| **Update Frequency** | Weekly | Monthly | Weekly | Monthly |
| **Privacy Sensitivity** | Very High | Medium | Very High | Medium |

## The Pruning Process

### The Challenge: Full People vs. Specific Scenarios

A complete model of a person contains thousands of traits, but role-playing scenarios need focus:
- **Full Mindscape**: 500+ traits, 1000+ experiences, 100+ relationships
- **Interview Scenario**: 20-30 relevant traits (question style, evaluation approach)
- **Colleague Chat**: 15-20 traits (communication style, shared context)

### The Selection Pipeline

#### Step 1: Scenario Analysis
```python
def analyze_role_play_scenario(request):
    scenario_type = request.scenario  # "technical_interview"
    person_role = request.role       # "senior_engineer_interviewer"
    fidelity = request.fidelity      # 0.8
    
    # Determine trait categories needed
    required_traits = SCENARIO_TRAIT_MAP[scenario_type]
    fidelity_traits = FIDELITY_LEVELS[fidelity]
    
    return TraitSelector(required_traits, fidelity_traits)
```

#### Step 2: Trait Filtering
```python
def select_persona_traits(mindscape, selector, context):
    # Start with core identity traits
    traits = {
        "identity": mindscape.get_core_identity(),
        "communication": mindscape.get_communication_style()
    }
    
    # Add scenario-specific traits
    if selector.needs_technical_knowledge:
        traits["expertise"] = mindscape.get_expertise_areas()
    
    if selector.needs_behavioral_patterns:
        traits["behaviors"] = mindscape.get_behavioral_patterns()
    
    # Apply fidelity level
    return apply_fidelity_filter(traits, selector.fidelity)
```

#### Step 3: Contextual Adaptation
```python
def add_contextual_overlay(persona_core, context):
    overlay = {}
    
    # Current state modifiers
    if context.time_of_day in persona_core.high_energy_times:
        overlay["energy_modifier"] = "high_energy"
    
    # Relationship context
    if context.relationship_history:
        overlay["shared_context"] = extract_shared_history(context)
    
    return PersonaWithOverlay(persona_core, overlay)
```
